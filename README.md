# rick_and_morty_solid_bloc

Clean architecture was implemented in this pet project. The application displays a list of characters of the series "Rick and Morty" in the amount of 20 pieces, which are cached in shared preferences (1st screenshot), and their further loading (2nd screenshot). Information on each character can be viewed in detail by clicking on it (3rd screenshot). The application implements a search by the name of the character (4th screenshot). The 5th screenshot shows the search result by the name of the character "Rick".
